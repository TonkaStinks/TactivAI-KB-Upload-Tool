- Know which browser you're using (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Set time range to "All time" for complete clear
2. Check "Cached images and files"
3. Optionally check "Cookies and other site data" (this will log you out of websites)

2. Wait for confirmation
3. Refresh the page you were having issues with

## Quick Refresh Alternative
Before clearing cache, try a "hard refresh":
- Windows: Ctrl + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R
- Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

This refreshes the page bypassing the cache without clearing everything.

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Still Seeing Old Content After Clearing
**Symptoms:** Website still shows outdated information
**Solution:**
- Close and reopen the browser completely
- Try a different browser to confirm the issue
- Check if your company uses a proxy that might cache content

### Issue 2: Logged Out of Everything
**Symptoms:** All saved logins are gone
**Solution:**
- This is expected if you cleared cookies
- You'll need to log back into websites
- Next time, only clear "Cached images and files" not cookies

### Issue 3: Website Broken After Clearing
**Symptoms:** Website doesn't work properly after cache clear
**Solution:**
- Close browser completely and reopen
- Try incognito/private mode
- Contact IT if issue persists

## Escalation Triggers
- Website issues persist after clearing cache
- Cannot access specific work-related websites
