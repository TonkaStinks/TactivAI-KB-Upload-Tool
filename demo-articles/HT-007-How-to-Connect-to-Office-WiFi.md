# How to Connect to Office WiFi

## When to Use This Article
Use this guide when you need to connect your laptop or mobile device to the company wireless network.

## Prerequisites
- Your device has WiFi capability
- You are physically in the office
- You have your company credentials (email and password)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open WiFi Settings
**On Windows:**
1. Click the WiFi icon in the system tray (bottom-right corner)
2. Click "Show available networks" or the arrow next to WiFi

**On Mac:**
1. Click the WiFi icon in the menu bar (top-right)
2. Make sure WiFi is turned on

### Step 2: Select the Company Network
Look for the network named **TactivAI-Corporate** or **TactivAI-Guest**

- **TactivAI-Corporate**: For company-owned devices (faster, full access)
- **TactivAI-Guest**: For personal devices (limited access)

Click on the appropriate network name.

### Step 3: Enter Your Credentials
When prompted:
1. Username: Your company email (e.g., jsmith@tactivai.com)
2. Password: Your regular network password (same as email login)

Click "Connect" or "Join"

### Step 4: Accept the Security Certificate
If prompted about a security certificate:
1. Click "Connect" or "Trust"
2. This is normal for enterprise WiFi networks

### Step 5: Verify Connection
- The WiFi icon should show connected (full bars)
- Open a browser and navigate to any website to confirm internet access

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Network Not Appearing
**Symptoms:** TactivAI-Corporate doesn't show in the list
**Solution:**
- Move closer to an access point
- Toggle WiFi off and on
- Restart your device

### Issue 2: Password Rejected
**Symptoms:** "Incorrect password" or "Authentication failed"
**Solution:**
- Verify you're using your email password, not a PIN
- Check if Caps Lock is on
- Try resetting your password at password.tactivai.com

### Issue 3: Connected But No Internet
**Symptoms:** WiFi shows connected but websites don't load
**Solution:**
- Open a browser - you may need to accept terms on a captive portal
- Try forgetting the network and reconnecting
- Contact IT if issue persists

## Escalation Triggers
