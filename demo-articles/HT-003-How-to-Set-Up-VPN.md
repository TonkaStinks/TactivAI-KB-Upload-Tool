# How to Set Up and Connect to VPN

## When to Use This Article
Use this guide when you need to work remotely and access company resources from home or while traveling. VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure connection to the company network.

## Prerequisites
- Company laptop with VPN software pre-installed
- Your company credentials (email and password)
- Internet connection at your location
- Multi-factor authentication set up

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Locate the VPN Application
**On Windows:**
1. Click the Start menu
2. Type "GlobalProtect" or "Cisco AnyConnect" (depending on your company)
3. Click to open the application

**On Mac:**
1. Check the menu bar (top-right) for the VPN icon
2. Or open Applications > GlobalProtect

### Step 2: Connect to VPN
1. In the VPN application, enter the portal address if prompted: **vpn.tactivai.com**
2. Click "Connect"

### Step 3: Enter Your Credentials
1. Username: Your company email address
2. Password: Your regular network password
3. Click "Sign In" or "OK"

### Step 4: Complete Multi-Factor Authentication
1. You'll receive a push notification on your Authenticator app
2. Tap "Approve" on your phone
3. Or enter the 6-digit code if using code-based MFA

### Step 5: Verify Connection
Once connected:
- The VPN icon will show "Connected" (usually turns green)
- You can now access company resources like internal websites and file shares

### Disconnecting from VPN
When finished working:
1. Click the VPN icon in your system tray/menu bar
2. Click "Disconnect"
3. This frees up resources and is recommended when not actively using company systems

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: VPN Won't Connect
**Symptoms:** Stuck on "Connecting" or times out
**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection first
- Restart the VPN application
- Restart your computer
- Try a different WiFi network if available

### Issue 2: Connected But Can't Access Resources
**Symptoms:** VPN shows connected but internal sites don't load
**Solution:**
- Disconnect and reconnect to VPN
- Clear your browser cache
- Try accessing via IP address instead of hostname

### Issue 3: Slow Performance on VPN
**Symptoms:** Everything runs slowly when connected
**Solution:**
- This is normal - VPN routes traffic through company servers
- Disconnect from VPN when accessing non-work websites
- Use wired ethernet instead of WiFi if possible

### Issue 4: MFA Not Working
**Symptoms:** Never receive push notification or code rejected
**Solution:**
- Make sure your phone has internet connectivity
- Check that the time on your phone is correct (auto-sync enabled)
- Try the manual code option instead of push

## Escalation Triggers
- VPN software missing or won't install
- "Access Denied" errors after successful connection
- Account locked out of VPN
